# Engineering on the Go (EngOTG)
***
  EngOTG is an Android project that provides auditory learning in physics concepts via audio lectures and interactive 
  voice response quizzes (IVR) for engineering students with the goal of 
  
  * increasing student attainment of engineering concepts 
  * provide students an effective method to study in different settings

### Abstract

There is significant evidence in educational research that students benefit the most from using mixed modality
learning styles (visual, auditory, and kinesthetic). Although auditory learning styles, such as recorded study materials
are commonly used in many disciplines, they have been seldom used in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
(STEM) education. In addition to providing students with an additional learning mode that allows repetition and practice,
it also offers the convenience of learning anywhere (on the go), aligning with the lifestyle of the new generation
of technology savvy students. Thus, the objective of this app is to investigate how the use of audio study materials
could improve student learning and attainment of basic engineering concepts, that are generally known by students to be
difficult and require substantial processing and repetitions.

### Impact on Student Learning

With a new generation of ‘digital native’ students, i.e., grew up with technology, it is anticipated that the use of an audio
study app that is accessible on their phones, would align with their lifestyle. It will provide them with a learning resource
which is accessible anywhere, and would ultimately improve their understanding of difficult concepts, as well as allow for 
practice and repetition at their own convenience.
